# script

Made for producing AICP, AOKP, and ViperOS ROMs for the TBLTE, TRLTE, and TRLTEDuos devices and uploads the flash file to Google Drive.

For each device, you will need lines 1, 2, 3, and 4. For TBLTE, include line 5. For TRLTE, include line 7. For TRLTEDuos, include line 9.
This will work for any of the three main scripts.
***Note: Change master.xml at the end of line 2 to match the device you are making. (i.e. tblte.xml, trlte.xml, or trlteduos.xml)***

Master.sh does runs all three scripts as well as telling you how much time was taken for running the entire sequence.

Pick and choose which you would like to run.
